This Project takes input (Image) from sources like Camera attached to drone, CCTV camera, or mobile app, and predicts the chance of Fire or Smoke in the images. The Project uses a Convolutional Neural Network, The CNN was trained on Images containing Manually cropped scenes of Forest Fires, Dark Smoke, Fire in Buildings, Fire in Farms, etc and Images which don't have fire.
